	Welcome to this Simple ROBLOX Whitelisting for your script(s).

		Author: nNullByte :)

	Note: This was asked of me by a friend that is new to scripting and I thought it might also help you to get an understanding of how simple whitelist systems are made.

	This is the table we are going to use to list all of our HWID / ClientID's.

	All you need to do is to replace the "Insert your HWID here." text with your HWID / Client ID and upload it to pastebin / github.

	Please note that you will have to manually update this table when you want to add another HWID in here.

return {
	"Insert your HWID here.",
	"Insert your HWID here.",
	"Insert your HWID here.",
